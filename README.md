# Magic Toggle

Magic Toggle is a macOS application that helps manage your Apple Magic devices across multiple Macs. It automatically connects your saved devices when an external display is connected, and disconnects them when the display is unplugged. This makes it easy to switch your Magic Mouse, Keyboard and other devices between different Mac computers while maintaining a streamlined workflow based on your monitor setup.
